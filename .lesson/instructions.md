# Inheritance Assignment

**Goal:** To learn more about developing an Object Oriented program and applying Inheritance by creating a program/application involving multiple classes that will do calculations and help someone better understand or use a simple mathematical concept.

Choose, plan/design (UML CLASS diagram), implement and test a software solution for a mathematical concept.
Some ideas are:
- Area and perimeter of 2D shapes (quadrilateralsâ€¦)
- Volume and surface area of 3D shapes
- Determining terms and sum of sequences
- Determining properties (angles, side lengths) of different types of triangles
- Determining properties (angles, side lengths) of different types of quadrilaterals
- Determining properties of a quadratic relationship based on the form (standard, factored or vertex forms)
- Other? Check with Ms. Luce!

This must be a concept for which you can define attributes (properties) and create methods (calculations). As well as having sub-categories represented by subclasses and inheritance. (For example all Quadrilaterals have 4 sides, some sub-categories (subclasses) can be rectangle, parallelogram, square and rhombus. In fact, a square can even be a further subclass of a rectangle, similarly so is the relationship between rhombus and parallelogram.

Your program MUST be written with an object oriented approach! 
That is, the criteria for an excellent program is:

* Classes with:
  * Attributes
  * Methods (class and instance)
    * Constructor(s)
    * Others such as functions and helper methods
* Instantiation and use of more than one Object
* **Inheritance and Polymorphism (overloading and/or overriding)**
* Apply other forms of class relationships (aggregation, composition or association)
* **TRY** to also write your application to have:
  * Encapsulation which can only truly be applied if there are multiple classes with SOME private methods (and attributes?)

**Create a SIMPLE UML CLASS diagram to represent the structure of the classes in your program! Turn it in on Classroom.
diagrams.net (drawio type files) is a good one to use in Google Drive**

NOTE: See the rubric on the Classroom google doc
